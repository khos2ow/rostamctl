            Outputs rostamctl shell completion for the given shell (bash or zsh)
            This depends on the bash-completion binary.  Example installation instructions:

            # for bash users
                $ rostamctl completion bash > ~/.rostamctl-completion
                $ source ~/.rostamctl-completion

            # for zsh users
                % rostamctl completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_rostamctl
                % autoload -U compinit && compinit

            Additionally, you may want to output the completion to a file and source in your .bashrc
            Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2
